### Project: E-Commerce ELT using dbt Cloud and Snowflake

#### Project Overview:
This project aims to build a robust ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for an e-commerce platform using dbt Cloud and Snowflake. The objective is to transform raw sales data stored in Snowflake into well-structured dimension and fact tables, enabling efficient and accurate reporting, analysis, and decision-making.

#### Key Components:

1. **Source Data**:
   - The raw sales data files are stored in Snowflake data warehouse, containing various details such as transaction dates, customer information, product details, and sales metrics.

2. **ELT Process**:
   - **Extract**: Retrieve raw data from Snowflake's raw data schema.
   - **Transform**: Use dbt Cloud to define and implement data transformation models that clean, standardize, and structure the raw sales data. This includes:
     - Creating dimension tables for customers, products, country and sales.
     - Creating fact tables to capture sales transactions, aggregating metrics like total sales, quantity sold, and profit.
   - **Load**: Push the transformed data back into Snowflake, stored in a new schema optimized for analytics.

3. **Data Models**:
   - **Dimension Tables**: These will include `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, and `dim_sales`, `dim_countries` ,which store descriptive attributes and serve as lookup tables for the fact tables.
   - **Fact Tables**: The `fact_sales` table will capture transactional data, linking dimensions to measure key business metrics.

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - **dbt Cloud**: Used for managing the transformation process, automating the deployment, and version controlling the models.
   - **Snowflake Warehouse**: Acts as both the source and destination for the data, ensuring seamless data flow and storage.

5. **Project Goals**:
   - Automate the transformation of raw sales data into a structured format suitable for analytics.
   - Ensure data quality and consistency through the use of dbt’s testing and documentation features.
   - Enable stakeholders to access timely and accurate data for reporting and analysis by maintaining up-to-date dimension and fact tables.
   - Facilitate scalability by leveraging Snowflake’s performance and dbt’s modular approach to data modeling.

#### Benefits:
- **Improved Data Quality**: The structured ELT process ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
- **Efficient Reporting**: With well-defined dimension and fact tables, stakeholders can generate reports quickly and accurately.
- **Scalability**: The use of Snowflake and dbt Cloud allows the ELT pipeline to scale easily with growing data volumes.
- **Automation**: Automating the ELT process reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and ensures data is always up-to-date.

#### Conclusion:
This project lays the foundation for a robust data infrastructure, enabling the e-commerce platform to leverage its data for strategic decision-making and business growth.
